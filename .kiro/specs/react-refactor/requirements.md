# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing Prophet AI SOC Analyst Platform from a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript application to a modern React-based single-page application. The refactoring aims to improve maintainability, scalability, and developer experience while preserving all existing functionality and the cybersecurity-focused user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be built with React and modern tooling, so that I can maintain and extend the codebase more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is refactored THEN it SHALL use React 18+ as the primary frontend framework
2. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL use Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
3. WHEN the application is developed THEN it SHALL use TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
4. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL follow React best practices with functional components and hooks
5. WHEN the application is organized THEN it SHALL use a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SOC analyst, I want all existing functionality to be preserved after the refactoring, so that I can continue using the platform without any disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL display the same dashboard with metrics, alert feed, and team status
2. WHEN I navigate between sections THEN the application SHALL show the same content areas (Dashboard, Alert Management, Investigations, Threat Hunting, Incidents, Analytics, Integrations)
3. WHEN I interact with alerts THEN I SHALL be able to view, filter, and manage alerts exactly as before
4. WHEN I use the investigation workspace THEN I SHALL be able to select investigations and view their details
5. WHEN I use threat hunting THEN I SHALL be able to execute queries and view results
6. WHEN I view analytics THEN all charts and performance metrics SHALL be displayed correctly
7. WHEN I check integrations THEN the system status and health information SHALL be shown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain the same visual design and user experience, so that the interface remains familiar and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders THEN it SHALL maintain the existing dark cybersecurity theme with the same color scheme
2. WHEN I view the interface THEN all visual elements SHALL appear identical to the original design
3. WHEN I interact with components THEN hover effects, transitions, and animations SHALL work as before
4. WHEN the application is responsive THEN it SHALL adapt to different screen sizes as the original did
5. WHEN I use the application THEN the layout SHALL remain consistent with the existing header, sidebar, and main content structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the React application to use modern state management and data handling patterns, so that the application is maintainable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application manages state THEN it SHALL use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) for local state management
2. WHEN the application handles data THEN it SHALL maintain the existing mock data structure and real-time simulation features
3. WHEN components need shared state THEN the application SHALL use React Context API for global state management
4. WHEN the application updates data THEN it SHALL preserve the real-time updates and notifications functionality
5. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL be optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have a well-organized component structure, so that I can easily locate and modify specific features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN it SHALL have separate components for each major section (Dashboard, Alerts, Investigations, etc.)
2. WHEN components are organized THEN they SHALL be grouped by feature in logical directory structures
3. WHEN shared functionality is needed THEN it SHALL be extracted into reusable custom hooks
4. WHEN styling is applied THEN it SHALL use CSS modules or styled-components to maintain component-scoped styles
5. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL have clear separation between components, hooks, types, and utilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to maintain Chart.js integration for data visualization, so that all existing charts and analytics continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN charts are rendered THEN the application SHALL continue using Chart.js for all data visualizations
2. WHEN the threat landscape chart is displayed THEN it SHALL show the same doughnut chart with threat severity data
3. WHEN analytics charts are shown THEN alert trends, response times, and threat categories SHALL be visualized correctly
4. WHEN charts are interactive THEN they SHALL maintain the same responsive behavior and styling
5. WHEN chart data updates THEN the visualizations SHALL reflect changes in real-time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to have proper development tooling and build processes, so that I can develop and deploy efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server runs THEN it SHALL provide hot module replacement for fast development
2. WHEN the application is built for production THEN it SHALL be optimized with code splitting and minification
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL be validated with ESLint and formatted with Prettier
4. WHEN TypeScript is used THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive type checking for all components and data structures
5. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL generate static assets that can be served from any web server

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored application to maintain the same external dependencies and integrations, so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL continue using Font Awesome icons via CDN
2. WHEN custom fonts are needed THEN it SHALL maintain the FKGroteskNeue font integration
3. WHEN Chart.js is used THEN it SHALL be properly integrated as a React-compatible dependency
4. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL not introduce any breaking changes to external API expectations
5. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL maintain the same browser compatibility as the original
